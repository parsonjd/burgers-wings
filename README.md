  ## Description
  Burgers & Wings is a MERN application for a restaurant focusing
                on hamburgers, wings and craft beer. A user can signup or login
                and order from the menu. The app uses stripe to process checkout
                upon completion of the order. It uses React for the front end,
                GraphQL with node and express on the backend, and MongoDB with
                Mongoose ODM for the database.
